## Cost Projections

These are estimates based on architecture decisions. Real costs depend on usage patterns.

| Users (DAU) | Monthly cost | GenAI credit duration |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — 100 | ₹0 (free tier) | Indefinite |
| 100 — 1,000 | ₹200 — ₹500 | ~15 years |
| 1,000 — 10,000 | ₹1,500 — ₹3,500 | ~2.5 years |
| 10,000 — 100,000 | ₹15,000 — ₹35,000 | ~4 months |
| 100,000+ | ₹50,000+ | Requires monetization |

**Major cost drivers ranked:**
1. Firestore reads (mitigated via aggressive caching)
2. Cloud Vision API calls (mitigated via image hash deduplication)
3. Cloud Storage egress (mitigated via CDN caching)
4. Gemini API (free under credit until exhausted)
5. Cloud Run compute (covered by free tier well into growth)

---

## Critical Path

The dependency chain that drives the timeline:

```
Phase 0  →  Phase 1  →  Phase 2  →  Phase 3  →  Phase 5
                                                    │
                          Phase 4 ─────────────────┤
                                                    ▼
                                                Phase 6  →  Phase 7  →  Phase 8  →  Phase 9
```

Parallel work possible:
- Phase 7 (Admin panel) can start during Phase 6
- Frontend (5,6) and DMs backend (4) can progress in parallel after Phase 3
- Documentation and legal pages updated continuously

## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| GenAI credit doesn't cover Gemini in production | Medium | High | Fallback to OpenAI-only at higher cost |
| Moderation accuracy below user expectations | Medium | High | Aggressive iteration via Phase 11 reviews |
| Cloud Vision costs exceed budget at scale | Medium | Medium | Image hashing dedup + sampling strategies |
| Play Store rejects app | Low | High | Pre-launch policy review, content rating |
| Solo developer bandwidth | High | High | Contributor onboarding, ship narrow scope |
| Firebase free tier exhaustion before launch | Low | Medium | Aggressive caching from day one |
| Sustained bot/spam attack post-launch | Medium | High | Rate limiting + Cloud Armor + manual review |

---

## Definitions of Done

A phase is complete when:

- All deliverables shipped
- Tests passing in CI
- Documentation updated to reflect changes
- No critical bugs in tracker
- Demo-able end-to-end
- Contributor (or another developer) can run the relevant components locally

---

## What We Are Not Building (Explicitly)

To preserve focus, these are explicitly out of scope:

- Marketplace, e-commerce, or in-app purchases (v1)
- Crypto, wallet, NFT features
- AR filters or face beautification
- Reels-style video editor
- Public APIs for third-party developers
- White-label or B2B offering
